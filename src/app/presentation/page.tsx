  description:
    "15-minute lightning talk at Microsoft Build: how prompts.chat grew from a GitHub repo into an open prompt ecosystem — platform, book, and game — for the age of agents.",
};

const speakerNotes = [
  "Okay, hi everyone. So I want to start with a mistake that, honestly, a lot of people make. They think that when AI models get smarter, prompts will not matter anymore — like, prompting is just a temporary trick and the next model will make it useless. But actually, for me, it's the opposite. Even the best models give you better answers when you give them better prompts. And in the age of agents, prompts are kind of like atoms — every agent is basically made of them. So no, prompts are not going away. They actually matter more than before. So in the next fifteen minutes, I want to show you why, and the open ecosystem I'm building around them: prompts.chat.",
  "But first, a quick hello. I'm Fatih. I'm a developer advocate on the WordPress team at Automattic. I also created the Awesome ChatGPT Prompts project, and I'm a GitHub Star. Okay, that's enough about me — let's actually talk about prompts.",
  "So, this whole thing actually started as a tiny GitHub repo. Just a simple list of prompts you could copy and paste. And one detail people are always surprised by — this is not new at all. I created it almost four years ago, literally about one week after OpenAI announced ChatGPT. The book came later. Honestly, back then I didn't expect much. But it kind of exploded — it became one of the most starred AI projects on GitHub, used by tens of millions of people. And that told me something: a good prompt is actually worth sharing.",
  "But here's the problem, right? Most prompts just get lost. They're hidden in screenshots, random gists, old chat history. No version, no owner, no review. That great prompt you wrote last week? It's probably gone the second you closed the tab. And okay, that's annoying for us as people — but honestly, it completely falls apart once agents are involved.",
  "So why does it fall apart for agents? Well, when an agent acts for you, the prompt is not just a casual message anymore. It's actually the plan. It's the contract. It's basically the source code for how that agent behaves. Look at this one — a role, a goal, the sources it can use, the limits, and when to stop. You really want to save and improve something like this, right? Not lose it somewhere in a chat.",
  "So this is exactly what prompts.chat does. It treats prompts as real, shareable things. You can discover good ones, fork them, keep versions, reuse them. And it's open source, so you can even host it yourself — your team actually owns its own prompt library.",
  "Now, why does being open matter so much, especially for agents? I'd say three reasons. First, you can actually read what the agent was told to do. Second, the same prompt works across different models and tools. And third, open prompts plug right into agents, editors, an MCP layer. So basically, a world full of agents needs an open world of prompts.",
  "Okay, now two things people don't really expect. The first one is a book. It's called The Interactive Book of Prompting. It's free, and it's not some boring PDF — it's actually interactive, with live demos you can try right there on the page, from the basics all the way to agents.",
  "And the second one is a game. So, this is Promi — a little robot — on an adventure through Prompt Land. It's a fun way for kids to learn how to talk to AI. Because, honestly, this skill shouldn't only be for engineers, right? It kind of belongs to everyone, including the next generation.",
  "So if you put it all together, you actually get one open loop. The repo where it all began, the platform to discover and reuse, the book to learn, the game to bring in new people, and an API and MCP layer that feeds everything back to both humans and agents. So good prompts come in, the community makes them better, and they go back out.",
  "Okay, so here's the big picture. As agents start doing real work, the prompt is how we steer them — it's becoming the interface to these systems. Now, around those prompts you need some tooling — a way to manage them, version them, test them, serve them. And a lot of people now call this the \"harness\". So, just to be clear, the harness is not the prompt itself — it's actually the tooling that keeps your prompts accurate and well-tuned. And honestly, the same model can give you very different results depending on how good that harness is. So let's keep this whole thing open, shared, and easy to improve — together.",
  "And that's pretty much it. So, come build this open prompt ecosystem with us. Check out prompts.chat, read the book, play the game with your kids, and take a look at the project on GitHub. Thank you so much — and I think we have a moment for maybe one question.",
